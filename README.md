# FirstRep
First repository I created for BE-DEV course of Winc Academy. Here the results of a BED-DEV assignment are placed, to be checked.
Probably this repository will be gradually refined. When more assignmentsare added, it may become clearer as what is an apporpriate repository structure.

Please leave the main-py here. This is the same file as main-py in the folder strings/main-py, but it should also remain under the FirstRep-root to preserve the link send for the assignment-evaluation.
