# FirstRep
First repository I created for BE-DEV course of Winc Academy. Here the results of a BED-DEV assignment are placed, to be checked.
Probably this repository will be gradually refined. When more assignmentsare added, it may become clearer as what is an apporpriate repository structure.

NOTE - Leave the file <main.py> here under the root of FirstRep !
 A copy of this file is in the folder strings. However this main.py should also remain under the FirstRep-root to preserve the link that was uploaded for the assignment-evaluation.
